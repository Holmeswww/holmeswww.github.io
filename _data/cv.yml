  contents: 
    - I have experience in Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Generative Models, Sequence Modelling, and Self-supervised Learning. I am interested in reinforcement learning informed by natural language. My long-term research goal is to enable RL agents to benefit from human written guides or manuals.
