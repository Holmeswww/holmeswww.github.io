  contents: 
    - I have experience in Vision, RL, Generative Models, Sequence Models, Self-supervised Learning, and GCNs. I currently work extensively with large language models and reinforcement learning. I am interested in solving sequential decision problems with information from unstructured natural language (e.g., instruction manuals or news articles). My PhD research focuses on enabling RL agents to solve sandbox or strategy games by reading human written manuals.
