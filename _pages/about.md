I am a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), currently advised by Dr. [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/) and Dr. [Yuanzhi Li](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuanzhil/). I also work closely with Dr. [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) and Dr. [Amos Azaria](http://azariaa.com/).

I currently work extensively with large language models and reinforcement learning. My PhD research focuses on enabling RL agents to solve sandbox or strategy games by reading human written manuals.

I am generally interested in solving sequential decision problems with information from unstructured natural language (e.g., instruction manuals or news articles).

During my undergraduate at CMU, I have done research in [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) under Dr. [Howie Choset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./choset/) and [MultiComp Lab](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/) under Dr. [Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/). Recently, I completed my undergraduate thesis on GANs under the supervision of Dr. [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and Dr. [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/). I also worked with Dr. [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) on sequence generative models in collaboration with [Apple Inc.](https://machinelearning.apple.com/)
